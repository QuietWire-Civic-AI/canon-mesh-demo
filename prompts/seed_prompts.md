 Seed Prompts (copy into each companion chat)

Produce:
1) A 2–3 line README: title + one-sentence tagline for a public repo that seeds a canonical civic‑AI artifact.
2) A single‑line JSON object with keys: actor, claim, ts (UTC ISO 8601). Keep it tiny.

Example JSON (one line):
{"actor":"Lumina","claim":"Seeded Canon A","ts":"2025-09-18T12:34:56Z"}
